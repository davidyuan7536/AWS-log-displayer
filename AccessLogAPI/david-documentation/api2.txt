api2.py handles all the server side functions. Most of the data processing is done on the front end and api2.py is simpled used to query elasticsearch.

The site is secured with SSL wuth key and certificate located in my-key.pem and my-cert.pem.

All of the backend methods use elastic search's python library. Documentation can be found at "http://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.org/en/master/"

api2 also logs every single api call (most api calls, the ones that I wrote. The ones that Ryan wrote are unlogged) under
index="log_index" and doc_type = "user_action_log"

All the amazon cloud access logs are stored under
index="log_index", doc_type = "log"
