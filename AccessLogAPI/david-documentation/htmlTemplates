Every page has a header and a side bar. These are polymer elements and can be found in
"static/header/header.html" and "static/sidebar/sidebar.html"

The pages that I were responsible for can be found in:

dashboard.html
aggregations.html
graphStats.html
graphTerms.html

dashboard.js and dashboard.css handles all the site's styling and javascript. The polymer elements all have their own native javascript
so dashboard.js is mainly only responsible for handling user authentication. User authentication is handled with a cookie. The cookie has a
TTL of 1 day. The cookie name is "laserficheCloudAccessLogUser" and the user ID should be stored under this cookie if the user is logged in.
